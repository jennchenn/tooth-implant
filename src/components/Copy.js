    A tooth implant is a prosthetic used to replace damaged or missing teeth. In
    the United States, over <b>3 million people</b> have dental implants, with
    around <b>500,000 surgeries</b> conducted each year. Dental implants are
    inserted directly into the patient's jawbone, and function like a regular
    tooth. This enables the patient to chew regularly, and restore their smile's
    appearance. The success rate of dental implant surgery is generally high,
    however there can be some complications.
