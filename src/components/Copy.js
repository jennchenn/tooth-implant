    A tooth implant is a prosthetic used to replace damaged or missing teeth. In
    the United States, over <b>3 million people</b> have dental implants, with
    around <b>500,000 surgeries</b> conducted each year. Dental implants are
    inserted directly into the patient's jawbone, and function like a regular
    tooth. This enables the patient to chew regularly, and restore their smile's
    appearance. The success rate of dental implant surgery is generally high,
    however there can be some complications.

  <p>
    This is the part of the prosthetic that is visible in a person's mouth.
    <br />
    <b>Materials used</b>: (a) metals - gold / alloys for their bionert
    properties; (b) porcelain / ceramic, zirconia - blend more seamlessly with
    the rest of the patient's natural teeth.

export const COMPONENT_ABUTMENT = (
  <p>
    This component serves as the connection between the implant post and crown.

  <ol className="leftAlign">
    <b className="marginNeg2Rem">Most relevant in practice:</b>
    <li>
      Implant becomes loose: failing osseointegration can be caused by allergic
      reaction, infection, or premature loading of the implant
    </li>
    <br />
    <b className="marginNeg2Rem">Other possible modes of failure:</b>
    <li>
      Mechanical failure of components (e.g. of the implant due to overloading)

    <li>Abrasion of the crown</li>

  <p>
    <b>Potential Materials Solution 1: </b>
    Titanium is resistant to corrosion and very biocompatible; zirconia offers
    good aesthetics. Combining both will allow for benefits of both materials to
    be apparent in the implant.
  </p>

export const SOLUTION_B = (
  <p>
    <b>Potential Materials Solution 2: </b>
    Adding a coating of hydroxyapatite (HA) can improve osseointegration.
    Enriching HA with nanoparticles (antibiotics) can help reduce the
    probability of infection. More information can be found{" "}

    Removing the abutment can be beneficial in preventing food particles from

  <p>
    Osseointegration refers to the fusing of living bone with a metal implant.
    Proper osseointegration is required for a permanent bond to form between the
    implant and the patient's jaw. For more information, take a look at{" "}
