  "A tooth implant is a prosthetic used to replace damaged or missing teeth. In the United States, around 3 million people have dental implants, with around 500,000 surgeries conducted each year. Dental implants are inserted directly into the patient’s jawbone, and function like a regular tooth. This enables the patient to chew regularly, and restore their smile’s appearance. The success rate of dental implant surgery is generally high, however there can be some complications.";

  "Titanium is resistant to corrosion and very biocompatible; zirconia offers good aesthetics. Combining both will allow for benefits of both materials to be apparent in the implant. Adding a coating of hydroxyapatite (HA) can improve osseointegration. Enriching HA with nanoparticles (antibiotics) can help reduce the probability of infection. Finally, removing the abutment can be beneficial in preventing food particles from getting stuck under the crown, thus preventing plaque build-up and infection.";
